				"answer": "As with any trading activity, there is always a risk of loss.

				"answer": "Yes, after purchase, tutorial & instructions will be sent to your email."
			},
			"q5": {
				"question": "Can the EA pass prop firm evaluations?",
				"answer": "The EA can indeed pass prop firm evaluations with careful management, planning, and optimization. Backtesting setfiles provides insight into expected performance under challenge conditions, allowing for risk adjustment to meet prop firm rules and targets. After identifying a balanced set that complies with these rules, itâ€™s advisable to live demo test the settings for about 3-5 days for further validation. This process helps ensure that the live test results align with backtesting outcomes, making it a viable strategy to start the challenge with confidence."
			},
			"q6": {
				"question": "Can it be used on a funded account?",
				"answer": "The EliteScalper is designed for both challenge and funded accounts. Once you secure funding, it's advisable to lower your risk exposure while leveraging the EA's impressive win rate to effectively grow your account."
